The objective was to predict 3 months of sales using the one year history of sales.

Analyzed customer purchase behavior to predict their purchases over the next 90-days. 

Created (RFM) features for 2 predictive models (90-day spend amount andspend probability).

Model1:
Classification Task where we predict, the probability whether a customer will buy or not.

Model2: 
Regression Task where we predict, the amount customer will spend in the next 90 days.
